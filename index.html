					<h2>About Charles Darwin</h2>
			        <h4>Switched from Medical Education</h4>
					<p>Charles Darwin enrolled in the medical education program at the University of Edinburgh however, he was fascinated by nature and paid minimal attention to his medical studies. Since he was more interested in nature, He enrolled at Cambridge to study divinity.</p>			
					<h4>On the Origin of Species</h4>    
					<p>Charles Darwin Wrote a book called 'On the origin of species'. Alfred Wallace also developed a theory of natural selection and wanted Darwin's opinion regarding it and its publishing. At this time, Darwin realized the importance of publishing his theory, otherwise the credit may have gone to Alfred Wallace if he ended up publishing his theory first.</p>
